# Hi there, I'm Jonathan Cassens 👋

### Machine Learning Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Physicist

I am a postgraduate student currently reading for an **MRes in Machine Learning and Big Data at Imperial College London**, with a background in **Theoretical Physics from UCL**.

I characterize myself as a "high-slope" engineer—bridging the gap between complex mathematical modeling and practical, shipping software. I combine the analytical rigor of physics with the "get-it-done" mentality of a full-stack developer.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Advanced Computer Vision models and Reinforcement Learning agents.
- 💼 **I have experience in:** Quantitative Analysis, Full-Stack Web Development, and Commercial Risk Management.
- 🗣️ **Languages:** English (Native), German (Native/Fluent).
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I used to play poker semi-professionally and worked as a dealer, which taught me everything I know about risk and probability.
